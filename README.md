# Arduino-FileTyper

FileTyper exports a UTI for Arduino .ino files and declares that they conform with the C++ UTI. This gives Xcode the information it needs to automatically select C++ as the syntax coloring option for Arduino files.

Quit Xcode. Launch FileTyper. Relaunch Xcode, and you'll never have to manually select C++ for Arduino files again!
